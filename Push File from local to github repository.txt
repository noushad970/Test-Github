first of all we need to create or add a folder which we need to push in github.com
than we need to open the folder in vs code or visual studio than we need to go to
terminal of the application. for make the directory or folder or local repository
to git repository we need to go to terminal and type:
git init
and press enter.than the folder or local repo will be git folder or git repo. now 
we can add any file or folder in the git repository which is previously local repo.
after adding file we can check status of the file from the command line by typing:
git status
for adding all the file in the git repository we need to type:
git add .
than all the file will add in git not github.com. than we need to commit the file
for that we need to type:
git commit -m "Any massage of the change's"
now for uploading all the file to github.com we need to first create a new repository.
than we need to access the github repository to the local system. for that we need to
type: 
git remote add origin (Repository link)
for checking origin we can type: 
git remote -v  
we can check which branch we are in now for that we need to type:
git branch
as default git branch is always in master in local but we need to rename it in main
for that we need to type: 
git branch -m main
finally for push all the change's or the files in github.com we need to type:
git push -u origin main
after that all the file will be added in github repository. here -u is use to make pushing 
commit more easy. because after this command we can add commit any file or folder from this
repository by typing 
git add .
git commit -m "push massage"
git push

so all commands are:

git init
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Any massage of the change's"
git remote add origin (Repository link)
git remote -v 
git branch
git branch -m main
git push -u origin main
git add .
git commit -m "push massage"
git push
